    "# Add custom hooks to monitor network properties\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in [this how-to](synops_loss_snn.ipynb), Sinabs provides functions to monitor network activities such as synaptic operations and firing rates. For this it uses the hook-mechanism of PyTorch modules. This makes it easy to monitor custom statistics by writing our own hooks. In this how-to we will see how we can use this to keep track of the number of neurons and shapes of the spiking layers in our networks.\n",

    "You might be surprised that the batch size is recorded as `50` and not `5` as defind above. This is because in Sinabs the batch and time dimensions are usually flattened out, so that the shape is compatible with the 2D operations of PyTorch, such as `Conv2D`. This is done by the `Flatten` layer in the beginning, and undone by the `Unflatten` layer in the end of the networks. Within the network, batch and time dimensions are only separated internally within the `IAFSqueeze` layers. Therefore to the hook it seems like the batch size is multiplied by the number of timesteps.\n",
