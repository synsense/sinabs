    "## Sinabs is based on PyTorch\n",

    "We want to re-use as much PyTorch functionality as possible. We use Linear, Conv2d and AvgPool layers to define weight matrices, whereas *Sinabs* layers add state as well as the non-linear activation to each of those weight layers. This is a definition of a simple SNN which takes as an input a tensor of (Batch, Time, Channels):\n"

If we feed a tensor that has an additional time dimension (Batch, Time, Channels, Height, Width) to such a layer, we will receive an error. In order for us to apply 2D convolutions across time, we have to make use of a small trick where we flatten batch and time dimension before feeding it to the Conv layer.
