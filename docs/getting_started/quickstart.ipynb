    "## Sinabs is based on PyTorch\n",
    "All of Sinabs' layers inherit from `torch.nn.Module`. Thus you will be able to access your parameters, wrap layers in a `nn.Sequential` module and all the other things that you would do with a normal PyTorch layer. \n",

    "## How to define your network\n",
    "We want to re-use as much PyTorch functionality as possible. We use Linear, Conv2d and AvgPool layers to define weight matrices, whereas *Sinabs* layers add state as well as the non-linear activation to each of those weight layers. This is a definition of a simple SNN which takes as an input a tensor of (Batch, Time, Channels):\n"

If we feed a tensor that has an additional time dimension (Batch, Time, Channels, Height, Width) to such a layer, we will receive an error. In order for us to apply 2D convolutions across time, we have to make use of a small trick where we flatten batch and time dimension before feeding it to the Conv layer. If the input is flattened, the `Squeeze` versions of spiking `Sinabs` layers understand and take care of expanding the time dimension appropriately, without any major changes to your model definition."
