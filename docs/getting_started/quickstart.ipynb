We use Linear, Conv2d and AvgPool layers to define weight matrices, whereas *Sinabs* layers add state as well as the non-linear activation to each of those weight layers.

If we feed a tensor that has an additional time dimension (Batch, Time, Channels, Height, Width) to such a layer, we will receive an error. In order for us to apply 2D convolutions across time, we have to make use of a small trick where we flatten batch and time dimension before feeding it to the Conv layer.
