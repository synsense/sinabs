    "Readout layer is used to **readout the classification results** from the chip. It is **driven by a slow clock**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has 15 channels(category id) and the index of each channel is starting from 1 to 15. In each channel, we count the number of events of the input neuron of each channel at every clock input (clock_slow) (counter is 16bit), all channels computes this parallely.\n",
    "\n",
    "    And we store the counted value during that **1-clock cycle in a 16bit register**. Then on the next clock cycle we count the events on that neuron and compute the total events during that clock cycle.And we put this in **another register.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    And then we do this **every clock cycle**, and compute the average of the events over **1, 16 or 32 clock cycle** (this depends on the configuration register). This way we have average(16-bit) of each channel we have.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then average signals of all 15-channel goes into **\"Find Maximum Average\"** block.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This block finds the average of maximum spiking neuron and outputs the **average information** (which is 16-bit), and it also outputs the **index of the maximum spiking neuron.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Then we have another block called **\"Average Select\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This block also receives the average output of all the channels,and in addition it also has an input called **AVERAGE_SEL** which can be set either through S2P interface or through configuration register. And then this block outputs the average value of the neuron pointed by AVERAGE_SEL<3:0> bits\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- And finally we have another block called **\"Threshold Compare\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This block, similar to others, receives the average otputs of all channels as an input, compares each of these averages (16-bit) of each channel with the threshold(16-bit) set by configuration register and the output of this block is called **threshold_compare<15:1>**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So we have one-bit representation of each channel as threshold_compare. If average output of the channel is bigger than threshold , the corresponding bit of threshold_compare becomes \"1\"  (average_X[15:0] > threshold<15:0> --> threshold_compare_X=1)"
