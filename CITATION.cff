  SINABS: A simple Pytorch based SNN library specialised for
  Speck
message: >-
  Sinabs (Sinabs Is Not A Brain Simulator) is a python
  library for the development and implementation of Spiking
  Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs). The library
  implements several layers that are spiking equivalents of
  CNN layers. In addition it provides support to import CNN
  models implemented in torch conveniently to test their
  spiking equivalent implementation  The project is hosted
  at https://github.com/synsense/sinabs
